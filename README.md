# 5 Axis Model From DSM

<br>

The 5-axis model from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a diagnostic tool used by mental health professionals to assess and diagnose mental health disorders.

<br>

It consists of five axes, each focusing on different aspects of an individual's functioning and mental health:

#### Axis I: Clinical Disorders

This axis includes clinical disorders such as mood disorders (e.g., depression, bipolar disorder), anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, eating disorders, and substance-related disorders.

<br>

#### Axis II: Personality Disorders and Intellectual Disabilities

Axis II covers personality disorders (e.g., borderline personality disorder, narcissistic personality disorder) and intellectual disabilities.

These disorders typically involve enduring patterns of behavior that significantly deviate from cultural norms and cause impairment in functioning.

<br>

#### Axis III: General Medical Conditions

This axis takes into account any relevant medical conditions or physical illnesses that may impact the individual's mental health or functioning. Examples include diabetes, hypertension, or chronic pain conditions.

<br>

#### Axis IV: Psychosocial and Environmental Problems

Axis IV considers the psychosocial and environmental factors that may contribute to the individual's mental health issues or impact their treatment. These may include stressors such as financial problems, relationship issues, or housing instability.

<br>

#### Axis V: Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale

The GAF scale provides a numerical rating (ranging from 0 to 100) that reflects the individual's overall level of psychological, social, and occupational functioning. Higher scores indicate better functioning, while lower scores indicate impairment.

### [Summary]

The 5-axis model aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of an individual's mental health status by considering various factors that contribute to their overall well-being and functioning. However, the DSM-5, the latest edition of the DSM, released in 2013, no longer uses the multi-axial system. Instead, it integrates some aspects of the axes into a single diagnostic framework.
